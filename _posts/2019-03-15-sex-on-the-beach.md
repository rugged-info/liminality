Sheer baby-T and balayage locks,

sand on sexy toes,

a coy smile,

invite my mind to dream, care-free.

But the pewter shell trinket

on that petite hemp anklet

is bouncing faster than my beating heart.  

Her anxious knee jagging up and down

tells me inside she's wound tighter than a drum,

and I hear the voice of my father say,

"high maintenance cannot smell the scent of patchouli"

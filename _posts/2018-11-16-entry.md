Join the other world,

slip past the veil,

trick the mind,

raise the hips from the water,

lift a leg,

think: “half of me is still in air.”

Now, reach with the arms,

pull like you are lifting yourself onto the metal ledge

of a bridge’s truss,

to shimmy along under the road,

where doppler sounds of cars approaching grow louder and

“SLAP!”

tires hit the metal collar of the bridge,

hear the low rumble of rubber on asphalt

as they pass overhead,

walk along the edge of that giant I-beam,

one foot in front of the other

as the bridge reaches across the span proper,

hand over hand,

your grip falling in between the heads of giant rivets

that fasten the road to the truss,

shadows of dusk blurring depth

you see mere shapes of what’s below,

a city’s infrastructure few have seen,

a world your own

with dusky hints of danger,

lean out,

away from the truss,

and feel the wind in your face.

Someday,

you could base jump,

risk it all and come back,

to do it again.

Just lean in and fall,

lean in and fall

into the abyss.

It’s dark below.

don’t you want to see

if you can reach the bottom?

lean in.

Reach your hands out,

grab the abyss and pull it towards you,

lean in and fall

until you slip beneath the surface.

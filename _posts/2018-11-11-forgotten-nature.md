I am a spirit born in the age of forgetfulness, into a people who destroyed native cultures,

by the time the dead showed remorse for their deeds,

their offspring were the last ones in a country to be identified as a color,

it was their karma to be lost,

amnesic of their cultural identity,

ignorant of their purpose in the world,

no one teaching them how to be men.

Human beings ingest energy through all five senses,

but the modern education system did not teach them anything but taste,

and they grew addicted to what they ate with their eyes.

Attention economy

mined their primordial energy,

video games fed their inherent desires

to defend and protect,

delusions of virtual victory

stirred an urge

to log onto porn sites.

They milked themselves of their essence,

distorting their views of the mother and the daughter,

wasting themselves in toilet bowls and dirty socks,

drowning in feelings of inadequacy they could not place.

Robbed of their masculine identity they lashed out,

but were drugged into submission,

labeled,

like bottles full of pills,

by a cabal of obsessed parents, teachers and psychiatrists,

lined up each morning, passionless mouths agape,

so they would stop squirming in their seats,

so they would not challenge authority,

so they would be placid, flaccid, destined to remain docile.


Rites of passage in this dark age of a man, then,

became the process of learning what it meant to be one,

and the lack of older men who had walked the path

meant millions of them had to try again and again to become one.

Most fell,

either violently or pathetically,

off the path of protector, patron, lover, friend and father.

While young women found goddess circles and ceremonies to introspect,

study the meaning of their moons,

the creation that transferred from beyond time to thought and manifest deed

inside of their wombs,

boys had only the empty reward of spreading their seed.

And if they shouted

Why do my guts feel empty and ache after I’ve been with them?

No one could answer.

The sacred lineage of mentors had been severed long ago.


By grace, one fought,

found light that came through cracks in walls dividing the country.

This personality,

this boy that was so lost

began to look for me.

During bouts of abstinence,

vows to renounce masturbation,

he broke addictions forced on him,

so he could touch his spirit,

and realize the source of his nature.

His eyes looking inside to where creation’s first moment repeats itself,

from a singular oneness, split into lover and beloved, intertwined, two natures swirling, complementing,

never one, never whole, always two needing to surrender to the other,

masculine feminine, gray blue, stone water, mountain river,

one shaping her realms, the other animating them with formless intensity

like the deep, molten core of the earth.

Handle its power.

Pull it from the testes into the heart,

project it as strength, compassion, and non-attachment,

so we can endure,

without the aggression, objectification and violence of our forefathers,

this vapid world that thinks they don’t need us.

So we can surrender,

to the goddess that shapes us.

And wait,

for more men to remember,

who they truly are.

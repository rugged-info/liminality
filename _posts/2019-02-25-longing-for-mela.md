Bullhorns hung on bamboo poles awaken, crackle and chant.

from the damp straw floor of a circus tent

A young man from the west

wrapped in a brown wollen shawl,

Looks outside:

dew steams from the cold sand

monks as old as stones

are walking to the water,

breath leaves their mouths,

rising along the backs of their ears,

swirling from the tops of their heads,

wrapping the Ganges in myst.

He watches with joyous fear

to bathe in the icy river

like everyone else

or be sent back

to the land where he can’t find a cold shower,

because it’s so easy to warm it.

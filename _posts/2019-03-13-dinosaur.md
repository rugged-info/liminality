old bones and old words

ash on the seething surface of a goddess

she is tired and hates herself

qualudes, orgies and your shared lust for power,

your fat lips and your heavy tongue

awaken her shame

and everything you did to coerce her,

memories she has, but cannot hold

and look at her children,

fester into cancer.

She explodes,

her cold winter will starve you of the starlight you seek

innocents will die in her fury,

so long as confusion over your downfall

is locked on your face,

petrified in sediment.

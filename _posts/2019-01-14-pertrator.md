Night after night she'd come

like a shark checking a cave.

A grouper lives inside

which must come out eventually.

A matter of time,

before his drunken mind let her slip the belt from his jean loops

with her mouth.

He destroyed her for showing how weak he was.

The emptiness of his ethics laid bare.

No crumb was left in the cracks for his ego to nourish the lie that he was a man.

His face, the steal hull of a ship run aground,

would be bent and mangled for the rest of his life.

The roaring furnace of battle, engulfing his heart,

another man's throat in his hands, nearly killing him for defending her,

did not taste like triumph.

Anger from his weakness merged with the pain of his crushed sinus,

his imploded orbit.

No more star. No more light. No more center. Nothing to revolve around;

a hapless meteor hell bent on collision and a path no longer his own.

He was a slave. So clear now, through swollen eyes, his bondage.

No destiny can be reached, but for the whim of his desire, by a man who can't say no.

It was the lack of preparation,

what he'd not been trained for,

not been told,

unaddressed, integral parts of his nature, ignored,

labeled as ED, ODD, ADHD.

Unconscious initiations, unguided rites of passage.

girls, so confounding,

So unrewarding when he expressed care and concern.

only validated by the wet admiration of the hot ones

when he went after what he wanted and took it.

Oblivious to the wisdom of restraint,

Nothing had come from being sensitive

so he'd slowly locked his cell

with broken face and bloody hands.

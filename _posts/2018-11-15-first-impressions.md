Wearing pale yellow pajamas,

fleece

with white plastic feet.

His brown eyes could watch a cashier at Austin’s grocery,

the bobby pins in her hair,

the cracks in her make up,

with the same interest

as he watched bugs bunny trick Yosemite Sam

or Road Runner frustrate Wiley Coyote,

on Saturday morning cartoons,

but his favorite was the Wacky Racers.


As long as he held his blue blanket,

he loved to smell when it was just unfolded and still cold,

He absorbed the world

without threats.

There was a corner on his blanket,

pulled to a tip, longer than the others,

he tickled his nose with.

At dinner parties,

he did skit comedy

called “blue blankey comics.”

lying on his stomach with blue blankey over him,

two hands grabbing the corners;

he flapped the wings

and announced he was a stingray.

For the finale,

he rolled himself up

two and a half times around

and said the word “burrito”

to the delight of adults.


In grade school,

he loved Michael Jordan,

wore zumba pants,

a Simpson’s t-shirt

that said “Don’t Have a Cow Man”

a prominent set of buck teeth

and a mullet

for his year book photo.


He could make his mom smile

if he sang “Achey brake heart”

by Billy Ray Cyrus.

She wasn’t working

when they lived in Chicago,

and the retail monster gorged

on the time his father had with his son,

who tried to involve him any way he could —

Salmon fishing with a vendor named Jim Daskalakis,

a raucous, cigar smoking Greek

captain of a small patrol boat in the Korean War

occasionally known to mention

the standard practice

of shooting the Korean sailors they found

stranded at sea

in the heads

as they reached for the gunwales.

Jim gave him 100 dollars every year for his birthday,

which he used to buy

a monumental amount of baseball cards,

Ken Griffey Jr.’s rookie card being the most prized amongst them.

Jim’s son Dean was a Porsche-driving lawyer who played with commodities futures.

To a boy, he was the coolest man alive.

At his first communion (his mother’s idea),

held at Jim’s house on the golf course (Jim’s idea),

Dean became his Godfather (his father’s idea),

where Dean asked “you ever seen a credit card before?”,

pulling, from his wallet

a dull, silver

VIP card

to a gentleman’s club

and the laughs, snickers of Dean’s friends,

and the big, brown 10-year-old eyes

took it all in,

absorbed the messages of these men in ways,

that only planets and stars know,

as they realign,

a cosmic turbine pulling on his being,

stop-cocks shut off the flow to well worn rivers of thought in his young psyche,

dump valves opened pipes and filled them with new energy,

tugging on his pituitary, new hormones were manufactured,

even the air he breathed became filled with different Karma,

the body stirred,

perception altered,

a foundation now lain,

change was coming,

and the fixtures of boyhood began to fade,

some subtle

some abrupt.

His Dad saw Jim as a second father.

the first had died in a recliner,

cigarette in hand recliner

when his Dad was ten,

the last image of him,

were the bubbles of blood that filled his mouth,

as the right side of his heart failed

and he drowned.

The last time he saw Jim

was when his Dad returned the brown envelope

Jim gave to him

for the deer hunting cabin up north.

They were between the inside and outside doors

of a supper club,

and he had a clear view,

three and a half feet off the ground,

could hear,

through his little ears,

the manilla crinkle

when his Dad made Jim keep the envelope, saying

“Tell the guys back in New York. The buyer wouldn’t play ball.”

but for years, this memory was blurred,

hidden by the visage of his father’s

teary eyes and lonely face,

his broken heart

coming to grips with the fact

to Jim, the vendor, Dad had been nothing but a buyer,

and his Ken Griffey Jr. Rookie card

was the 1st kickback

for services rendered

his son had ever taken.

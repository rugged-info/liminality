Shielded by wrinkled mountains

blocking the trades;

a place where the winds do not strike the ocean,

the water remains calm;

known by sugar barons and Chinese traders

anchored there

as the Landing.

Remnants of a wharf lie

in crumpled piles on the ocean bottom,

a reef grown around them,

like a small moon,

eaten from the land,

pocked sand,

like craters,

but they are only crab holes.


10,000 Akule,

swim past as I hold my breath.

A swirling, dark entity, I see

bright silver flashes,

in the mass

like lightning coruscates

in a thunderhead,

far away with no sound, no violence,

only awe as it approaches,

as no bolt is separate

from the cloud

each glint of single fin

seems a scale

on a bigger fish, the entire school

one soul.

Shape, shimmer, and swirl

speak to me,

like tea leaves and bones,

oracle smoke,

figures, faces form in the plumes.


This mass of fish

thrives together and

mourns together,

which is why I have come down here:

to tell them where the fishermen are,

and which baits they use today,

to warn them,

as I have since they came to breed,

to be a traitor

of my own kind,

who will sink to the bottom

to meet with his handlers.

They don’t know I’m down here.

They don’t know

that when I sit on the wall overlooking their casts

and ask them what’s biting,

what the conditions are,

what baits they are using,

at what depths they are fishing today,

that I can repeat all this

without breathing,

to the being they call a “bait ball”,

through the organ that still beats

when I am immersed,

enwrapped by the pressure,

lulling the front of my mind back to the time

I was in the womb,

one with the mother.

Creation

can still be experienced

at the Landing,

in the place men cast into,

hoping to pull sustenance from the depth,

but refusing to be devoted to her,

where the traders entrust their ships

but do not surrender their souls.

It is their loss.

I know the sacred place

hidden beneath their gaze,

and it is ours,

mine and this being of ten thousand fish

casting me in humble shadow,

our communion

our temple

held in the bitten moon

of the Landing.

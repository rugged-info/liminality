Spoons clanking plates and

conversation rising just above

a Spotify playlist —

big bands blowing trumpets and trombones —

in the restaurant.

A tattoo of Rosie the Riveter

on the arm of a hipster waitress,

serving malt shakes and nachos

to a table of girls

who all went to school together.

Lauren, still single,

Janet, worked too much,

Monica was fed up with Professor Nielsen,

and they all looked up to Jessica.

“There’s the lucky girl!”

“I’m so happy for you I can hardly look at you, my dear.“

Their joyous envy a vague memory,

merged with the swoosh of the revolving door

after they paid and left,

said a happy goodbye,

Jessica skipped backwards into the cross walk.


Screeching tires,

a roaring engine,

a cracking femur,

like a sack filled with mud

thrown on a dike,

her body landed in the road.


Fabric ripping,

the gritty growl of pebbles scraping flesh,

I fell to my knees beside her.

One agonal breath gurgled from her throat;

I sucked in her final icy exhale;

and it sounded like glass shattered in my lungs.


Tympani and wind chimes, black kettles, hung,

banging in the wind, thoughts

struggling to understand Jessica was leaving.

The stars opened up and she was gone,

leaving me her karma,

her breath now flowing into my heart and through my arteries,

bathing me in her death.


My destiny changed course

before I even thought to start CPR.

It was a deep groan rising from the soul of a ship

as the mains caught,

and the rudder wrenched the vessel round,

the nails screaming in the wooden planks,

twisting and bending from the torque of the wind;

the bow, heaving, crashed headlong into the storm

with such force

my spine rattled, and

nothing was left in the crew except fear and surrender.


I am left to sort out what I must do now,

to live off this random act of death,

and hear the sounds repeat themselves in my head;

the pants of a young woman

as she is the second one to reach her,

her mouth making a seal over her blood and snot filled face,

two hollow breaths enter Jessica’s destroyed abdomen

“I am a lifeguard,”

she gasps as she comes up for air

“I know CPR.”

Above me:

“Is there anyone here with medical training?”

“I’m an anesthesiologist.”

He replaces me,

holding her head straight and checking her pulse.

I stand.


From behind me,

the screech of rosin on violin strings

when the bow moves too slowly,

so I turn.

Her three friends are there.

Monica’s hands shake as she gives me Jessica’s phone,

“Her… Her… boyfriend. We need to call Derrick.”

“I… I … I … can’t, can you?”

No one answers. My voice leaves a message.

“Hi Derrick, my name is Mark. I’m uh … I’m calling you about your girlfriend Jessica. She’s been in an accident and the friends she was, is with are trying to get a hold of you. The paramedics are taking her to the hospital. You can either call Jessica’s phone, or you can call … What’s your number dear?”


The flashing red lights of the ambulance don’t make noise

they only strike my eyes and disorient me,

expecting to hear chaos and siren,

I lean in,

as if to press on a wall and depend on it,

but it’s not there,

only the clang of the metal stretcher as it’s pushed into the rig

the thud and click of the EMT, pressing on her chest,

another one keeps her limp arms from falling over the rails.

Some clueless bystander says:

“Are you guys family?”

“You better say goodbye now. They’re taking her to the hospital, but this is probably the last time you’ll see her. It doesn’t look good.”

Lauren throws up in the gutter.

I put my hand on her back,

“She just got engaged,”

she says,

“Derrick was her fiance.”


To him, now,

I am the sound of her death.

Now,

we both hear shattered glass in our lungs.

wandering,

wondering,

how do I get her breath out of me?

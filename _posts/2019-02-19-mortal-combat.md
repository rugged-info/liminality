Embattled mind,

fractured with ignorance,

torn and tempted by the power that grows beneath it

thin filaments connecting chakras,

white hot and fraying

as more prana begins to flow it bursts from my testes once again,

the Will within too weak to hold a channel up through my heart,

like sitting on a bull with raging horns and slobber flying,

the roar of adrenaline and sex absorbs my shakti.

Ignorance is smoke, drifting across the battlefield,

obscuring the angle of attack.

I wait entrenched for the next onslaught of my karma,

a part of me growing stronger is racing to beat another who dines violently with each failure,

feasting on the carcass of my existence.

My screams meet the vacant eyes of children starving with kwashiorkor, and the beaten whores of Africa

I once fought for.

I am swallowed by bouts of sadness,

and lack of purpose.

The periosteum of my bones is aflame each morning,

an autoimmune disorder that burns as

I lacerate myself for the sins of our past,

the weakness of my present,

my only hope in the trenches of this human incarnation

is the photo of my guru and the red rock of Hanuman I pray to

as mortars destroy the last remnants of my ego's defenses

I can only surrender

for a thousand years it will take

to pull this sacred energy from the depths of my soul

without tainting it's purity,

without coloring it with the veils of want

the practice of discontent that consumes society,

the pornographic definitions of sexuality,

the goal oriented nature of my masculine cultural identity,

driving my body to go forth and conquer,

investing the gift of conscious awareness into the creation of wealth,

wasting the trickle of energy that manages to reach my third eye

on envisioning an easy life, free of challenges.

Become my solace.

Now, on the battlefield I am learning to call home,

healed fractures and torn ligaments scream as I bow.

heat grows in my guts through my practice,

becomes the only sign I have that I am getting somewhere,

that I am becoming a being that is deeper,

capable of truly loving,

getting ready to die in a way that doesn't deposit this life into something so ephemeral as a job title,

to die for god,

to live for others,

so the prayer becomes to let it all come crashing down.

Don't leave a single stalk of wheat unburnt

Scorch my earth and leave my feeble persona in the flames,

so what remains is the hardened ores of metals in the ground,

an iron will polished and walked across the field,

shoved into the transcendent core of me as a conduit for divine energy to reach the crown and merge with eternity.

Gwinnett County, Georgia: the second fastest growing county in the nation

in 1993,

28, 29

hundred children

packed

into brand new schools.

Tiny societies filled with drama,

bitches and bullies trying out for cheerleading,

football and first violin,

everything surrounded by swim-tennis communities,

stucco and 4 sided-brick homes taller

than sycamore saplings,

that would not reach the roof tops for more than a decade.

Until then everything would seem contrived,


make-believe,

pretend,

as if Atlanta wasn’t 30 miles away,

like poverty, drugs, illicit sex and deceit wouldn’t reach into the suburbs

so long as we built more castles,

made of two by fours and paper thin walls,

a little further away

than the last ones.

But the city did come,

the kids brought it in.

They were bored;

eating mozzarella sticks at “ The Edgewater” swimming pool

wasn’t enough for them.


And his little brown eyes,

saw many things

in only the way the naive manage to crush their own innocence,

manage to find themselves

in Jeb Cross’s jeep

going to a crank dealer’s house,

100, quarter-gram felonies in the twisted corners of plastic baggies

bundled on the coffee table,

with the moans of Lauren Hall, one of the hottest 15 year old cheerleaders,

from the bedroom.

Her friend opened the door

and said “I’ve got to go.”

he saw her getting screwed,

by a senior, John Bearden,

her white cotton panties

with candied hearts that said ‘hug me’

dangling from her right heel,

lifted in heat,

as everyone laughed.


The strain of these visions

corroded his nature,

and sounds of his parents beginning to fight,

thrum of his father complaining broadly about women,

mixed with his own burgeoning karma,

soiled the water,

running through the family.

the solid ground of his childhood, growing muddy

by the deeds of his past lives,

until, finally,

Matt Neubauer shoved him

in his puffed up teenage chest

at Collins Hill Park

and said

“Make your move, bitch.”

One hundred teenagers, there to watch,

had been told

about the fight

by Matt’s friend, Tommy Leight

who jumped around them,

like Don King,

and as a curtain closes on an act

opening with the scene changed —

the steal toe boot

applied to his temple, skull

shut the lights on his childhood

and rose,

a new scene set,

on his adolescence,

head, face, brain swelling,

shoving the amygdala into the magnum foramen

as stones leave kidneys,

bloody fire, excruciating,

raging anger,

ripping all in the way

pushed irrationally from behind,

screaming at his mother in the emergency room,

blaming the world,

refusing to cooperate with the police officer,

and realizing

the hospital only stunk

because he’d shit his pants.

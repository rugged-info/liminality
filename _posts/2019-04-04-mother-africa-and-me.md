Oppressive heat of poverty

beat down

Wide pupils

absorb the squalor  

reflecting sun's rays in a darker, Blacker color,

seas of tin roofing

undulate underneath an equatorial sun,

lives living and dieing in nameless ways,

stalked by the dark, languid spirit of Malaria,

Africa, an unknown power,

Enter my veins so I come alive with the raw anger and hunger of life.

Everything stronger, harsher,

more passionate, more heartbreaking, more profound, more deadly,

polio victims, shriveled limbs set on skateboards,

street kids hi on glue, sleeping in sewers,

a dead child abandoned amongst blades of windblown grass

and I was ashamed, afraid

if his vacant eyes followed the breadcrumbs along the path of blame it would lead back to me,

Why the hell was I doing this?

Was this entire trip inherently selfish?

Raised in a house of stucco,

psyche built upon proving I was cool,

unworthy, because I’d never felt hungry

a spoiled brat slapped the world in the face

embraced a lethal liberalism,

my affluence built upon genocides of indigenous,

I hopped a plane to right some devious wrong

wrought upon the world by my forefathers,

but I was there to save myself more than others.

there to discover that suffering only lives in black and white on paper,

a singular accusation toward my race and gender

disperses against reality - a twisted tapestry of events woven by many:

that yelling in Swahili?

is the Middle Eastern legacy of a slave trade

hidden from my books by the guilt of our own deeds,  

this dark continent filled with vultures that pick the carrion of our good intentions.

A black plastic bag of fear, ignorance and corruption wrapped around 800 million people

gasping for air,  

Histories filled with tribes and hierarchy

raping our birthplace

stealing her ovaries to put them on our fingers,

uranium and oil,

gold, and emeralds mined from her womb,

the neglected, disease infected origin of humanity

like our sexuality, disguised as exploration,

deny the sacred, pillage your primal core,

drowning in humanity's suffering

Where sense of separation fuses like the core of a star,

No longer hydrogen,

No longer love,

no longer violence,

no longer hate,

only life,

from all sides,

visions of why I’d come here came to me:

the cold reality of human nature mixing with my heritage and ethnicity,

Mid-west boys,

dressed like gangsters,

smoking cigarettes on street corners

listening to rap music while our parents

ate their supper in suburbs,

trustafarians banging drums on Maui, pretending to be poor,

hoping distance would help us heal from the reasons our families became rich in the first place,

we flowed from the karma of an empire winning predominance through dominance,

Creation of affluence via pestilence,

a soul incarnated into a generation of white kids,

estranged from our cultural identity,

trying to adopt another,

but losing ourselves in the process.

clinging to the emotions of centuries slain

the jaws of flaming skulls cried

carry the burden of my justice!

you are the perpetrator!

adopt us as your tormentors!

but I dove into the crucible before the claws could grab my heart

and released myself from the guilt of colonial legacy

The brain child of capitalism,

genes sowed in European and Macedonian cities,

amalgamating histories achievements and atrocities,

drinking from the same astral cistern all thirsty spirits draw from

I died with coal in my chest,

was flogged by the same masters whip,

light died from my sunken eyes, wrapped in the same diseased blankets,

we are all honorers of the sacred,

come from the same earth as the blood once spilled,

only human,

only me,

Mother Africa and Me.

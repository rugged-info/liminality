Given to the current,

he floats.

Cradled in the buoyant warmth of a wet suit,

waves rise and fall,

the water’s edge lapping at his ears,

sounds of the realm beneath

and the world he walks in,

alternate.

At the boundary,

buoyancy frees him from gravity,

vertebral spaces expand,

blood flow reaches all nerves,

disks are bathed,

as he is.

Muscles that spasm,

grind his aging joints,

are released.

Very little will be expected of them in the watery deep.

He must ready his being

to move soft, subtle, efficient,

the viscous difference between air and water

makes it imperative

to let go,

be loose,

relaxed.

Deeper energy flows grow visible underwater,

but it is because you are dying;

you have accelerated your karmic pursuit of death,

compiled one hundred years of living

into a single breath,

all you have,

all you take with you from the other world

when you dive

is air.

Mammalian bodies are no longer of the ocean;

spirit sheds them quickly,

a last breathe released underwater ascends, races,

to the world it came from,

because it was not supposed to be there.

Yet he learned as a boy,

challenging his teachers,

sometimes

when you break a rule,

step onto the opposite side of a law,

there is hidden knowledge,

a different perspective

that can be found,

no one else has,

and sometimes these experiences

are worth the consequences.

So he sets his watch

to breathe for two minutes,

through his snorkel,

preparing to cross over,

staring out his mask,

into blue and white rays of sunshine,

striking fixtures of oceanic water columns,

squid eggs and plankton,

refracting,

like a crystal chandelier

swinging in the sky.

His inhale

packs a billion tiny bubbles of air in his skin, his eyes, his muscles, his organs,

wherever they will fit,

recruiting them on a journey;

oxygen

hungry,

yawning

void of empty space

pulling electrons

towards them,

creating flow

for the body to harness,

animate his limbs,

calm his mind,

and sustain him while he dives.

The more flow there is,

the more treasures he can bring from the deep.

Why risk it?

We dive because there are lessons, voices, beings

in other realms.

When we bring back what we’ve learned

from the water worlds

to places of gravity and air

our lives are richer,

more fulfilling.

After we return from the deep,

we understand what it means to be here

in a body,

standing upright on solid ground.
